# KISAKI: generative NFT collection

## Layers mechanism

Each layer has it's own representation in a numeric value. All the possible pictures are assigned to numbers starting from 1.
All the numbers are generated using Randomizing mechanism.
At the end the Node JS code combines all the parts to a CANVAS and then exports it to a PNG file.
